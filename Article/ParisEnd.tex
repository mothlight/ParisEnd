\begin{abstract}

The confluence of recent advances in availability of geospatial information, computing power, and artificial intelligence offers new opportunities to understand how and where our cities differ and also, how they are alike. Departing from a traditional `top-down' analysis of urban design features, this project analyses millions of images of urban form (consisting of street view, satellite imagery, and street maps). A (novel) neural network-based framework is trained with imagery from the largest 1692 cities in the world and the resulting trained models are used to compare within-city locations from Melbourne and Sydney to determine the closest connections between these areas and their international comparators. This work demonstrates a new, consistent, and objective method for understanding the relationship between cities around the world, and the health, transport, and environmental consequences of their design. The results show specific advantages and disadvantages using each type of imagery, and we draw some conclusions about the best use of each for specific analytic goals. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this research also answers the age-old question, ``Is there really a `Paris-end' of your city?''.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}


Cities are now home to the majority of the world's population with trends predicting continued growth in urbanisation \citep{UNDESA2015,WHO2016}. Residents in the 2015 United Nations list of cities with populations exceeding 300,000 residents \citep{UN2014} account for 2.2 billion people (or approximately 31\% of the world's population) in 2015. Australia, in particular, leads this trend of high urbanisation. In 2013, 65\% of Australians lived in capital cities and it is estimated that this will increase to 72\% by 2053  \citep{ABS2008}. These projections are reflected in population growth estimates that will see the country's population likely increase from 24 million today to over 33 million by 2050  \citep{ABS2008}. This growth is expected to mostly take place within the four largest capital cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Perth) with projections indicating that by 2053 both Sydney and Melbourne will have populations of almost 8 million  \citep{CommonwealthofAustralia2010}. As a consequence of this population growth in urban areas, an array of planning, transportation, and population health challenges will emerge.

The importance of integrating transport plans with decisions regarding land-use is being recognised by governments \citep{ATAP2016,SAustralia2015}. Land-use decisions significantly influence transport options and travel choice. Further, the high levels of low-density suburbanisation and high car dependency that characterise many cities (in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and more) are remnants of a mid-twentieth century focus on home and car ownership \citep{Currie2007,Dodson2008}. As a consequence, the status and practical utility of cycling or walking for daily travel requirements is limited \citep{Heesch2014,Daley2011}. Low-density housing renders the cost of large-scale public transport prohibitive, producing a reliance on private vehicles and increasing exposure to risks associated with traffic speed, volume, emissions, and physical inactivity  \citep{Cepeda2016,MingWen2008,Norman2006}. Although some progress has been made in promoting active modes of transport the percentage of Australians walking or cycling to work remains low and primarily concentrated in low-speed, inner-city areas where distances are minimal. Public health policy-makers and urban/transport planners have an opportunity to change this situation by embracing strategies that proactively support active transport modes as facilitated by urban designs witnessed in other countries around the world.

For example, Copenhagen's significant long-term investment in cycling infrastructure, over 2 billion DKK (\euro 268 million) since 2004 \citep{Copenhagen2017b} for a city of approximately 550,000 residents, has seen its rates of cycling mode share expand to 45\% of all trips without consequent increases in road trauma \citep{Kaplan2014}. Similarly, Amsterdam's (and the Netherlands more generally) continued leadership in active transport promotion has demonstrated that cycling and walking can be re-claimed in areas and streets previously lost to car traffic, producing both health and economic benefit \citep{Andersen2000}. Substantial published evidence indicates that land-use affects transport modal choice and behaviour  \citep{Giles-corti2016,Kleinert2016,Goenka2016}. In addition, improved population health outcomes related to chronic conditions such as respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and Type 2 diabetes are strongly linked with more active transport modal choices  \citep{Zapata-Diomedi2017}. Therefore, the creation of cities and precincts that facilitate greater uptake of safe, active transport could produce manifold environmental, productivity, and population health benefits. 

However, understanding the association between urban design features, transport networks, and health or environmental outcomes remains difficult, especially when underlying data, locations, methods, and demographics upon which statistical models are built vary considerably. As a result, globally consistent comparisons between cities are difficult to achieve. To overcome these limitations, we develop a new framework using an entirely new and highly efficient `bottom-up` approach. Utilising recent advances in computing power and artificial intelligence, as well as an increased availability of globally consistent urban imagery, we train three neural networks with using millions of images of urban form (consisting of street view, satellite imagery, and street maps) from hundreds of world-wide cities. 

Paris, France is a widely recognizable international iconic city \citep{Anholt2006}, leading to many cities to claim that they have a `Paris-end' of town \citep{Williams2010}, or are a Paris on the [insert name of local river] \citep{Wilden2013} (i.e. Paris on the Yarra). Melbourne and Sydney are no exception to this rule. Visual elements of Paris are widely recognizable \citep{Doersch2012}, but can Melbourne or Sydney truly claim to have a `Paris-end'? Is Melbourne `Paris on the Yarra' or Sydney `Paris on the Parramatta'? Using the trained neural networks, we evaluate a systematic sampling of imagery from Melbourne and Sydney to find the closest connections between these areas and their international comparators, testing whether either Melbourne or Sydney can really claim to be `Paris-like'.

However, while potentially making some local tourist boards unhappy (the results definitively answer the question with a `no', `no', and `no' for both cities using three data sets), we also present a fundamental methodology to objectively analyse urban areas using big data imagery. In the process of answering this question, we uncover some specific advantages and disadvantages to analysis using each different type of imagery. We find that each of these data sources uncovers a unique set of urban typology characteristics and that successfully using this analysis technique for urban typological purposes requires an understanding of what characteristics will be emphasised by the varying training data sets.




\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}
\subsection{Neural network}\label{sec:methods1}

The methods in this study are based on artificial intelligence, in particular deep neural networks \citep{Bishop1995,Samarasinghe2016,Graupe2013}. Neural network architectures that have proven to be particularly successful at image recognition tasks are convolutional neural networks \citep{Schmidhuber2015}. These networks generally consist of alternating layers with convolution operations (for feature identification) and max-pooling operations (improving translation invariance and reducing dimensionality). To increase robustness of these complex models, techniques such as weight regularisation and dropout can be applied \citep{Srivastava2014}.

The model for image recognition used in this study is based on a newer version of the Inception architecture \citep{Szegedy2015}, which demonstrated better computer vision performance than any other methodology during the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) \citep{Russakovsky2015} in 2014. In particular, we use the third version of Inception (Inception V3) \citep{Szegedy2015a}, achieving even higher performance on ILSVRC by factorising large spatial filters into smaller convolutions, combined with more aggressive regularisation. These Inception models optimise the computational budget required to calibrate the network, while increasing depth and width of the neural network structure to allow for additional complexity.

\subsection{Imagery sampling}\label{sec:methods2}

The concept used in this study is to identify a city based on different types of imagery (street maps, satellite remote sensing, and street view images). By classifying images as belonging to a specific city and training a neural network with this data, the resulting model can accurately determine unique features associated with individual city and make predictions of imagery from an unknown city and classify them as similar to another city present in the training data.

Cities were selected using a United Nations World Urbanization Prospects, starting with a list of 1692 cities with greater than 300,000 residents \citep{UN2014}. Data from Google Maps and Baidu Maps was used to identify urban form for each of these cities in a globally consistent framework. (The specific imagery, sources, and neural network variations will be discussed in more detail in the following imagery sources section.)

The sampling area for each city was chosen as a circular area aligned to the city's centre, where the radius $r$ (km) of the sampling area was determined based on the population size $p$ according to \cite{Barthelemy2016}:

\begin{equation}
r = \sqrt{ \frac{28.27}{\Pi} \bigg( \frac{p}{300,000}  \bigg)^{0.85} }
\end{equation}

Having identified individual cities, a two-stage sampling approach was applied. Firstly, a sampling area with a centroid derived from the United Nations dataset and with a radius of 1.5 km was set as a baseline; this was necessary particularly for cities with lower populations (e.g., Christchurch, New Zealand or Izmit, Turkey). As sample cities' populations increased in size, the sampling area was increased by a power of 0.85 to the proportional increase in population size \citep{Barthelemy2016}. Standardising the sampling area in this manner avoided socio-political discrepancies relating to a city's `true' boundary. Further, it captured differences in population density and shape between cities while also appropriately adjusting for areas of the world's mega-cities namely, cities with populations exceeding 10 million people (e.g., Tokyo, Japan;  Delhi, India). Location sampling areas were also adjusted for the earth's curvature using the Haversine approximation of the great circle distance to the city's centre \citep{Sinnott1984}. 

Further, large water bodies were removed from this area, since these are not highly indicative of urban form. As a first step, coastlines were identified using the Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Geography database, version 2.3.6 \citep{Wessel1996}. Using QGIS \citep{QGIS2009} it was determined whether a sample was located off-shore. Off-shore samples were iteratively replaced by new random samples. Second, after the initial download, completely blue images were iteratively replaced by a new random sample to remove any lakes. Partly blue images have been retained.

These procedures result in a population and water body-adjusted circular area centred on the city's central coordinates. For example, Figure \ref{fig:hongkong}  shows the resulting sampling locations for Hong Kong.

\label{fig:hongkong}  
\end{figure}


\label{methodsimagery}
\subsection{Imagery sources}


For each city, three neural networks were trained respectively (see Table \ref{tab:neuralnetworks}) using street maps, satellite imagery, and street view imagery. It was attempted to use imagery for all 1692 cities. However, imagery from Sydney and Melbourne was not included in the the neural network training data sets, but was used separately as evaluation data. Images were downloaded from each of the following sources, using the appropriate APIs, using Python \citep{Python2016}.


\begin{table}[!htbp]
\caption{Neural networks trained and evaluated in this study \label{tab:neuralnetworks}}     
\begin{tabular}{ l l }
 \hline Abbreviation   &  Imagery source \\ \hline
GM & Google Static Maps API, image type of `map'     \\ 
GS & Google Static Maps API, image type of `satellite'      \\
GSV-BSV & Google Street View API/Baidu Street View API     \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The first neural network (which will be referred to as GM) used precinct-level Google Maps images as training material. These were obtained from the selected locations using a custom style defined with the Google Static Maps API \citep{GoogleStatic2017} (see Figure \ref{fig:maps} for examples of Paris, France). Due to mapping inconsistencies in South Korea, all 25 South Korean cities were removed from the dataset, reducing the number of cities to 1665. The images, sized 320 by 320 pixels, provide a high-level abstraction of road (black) and public transport (orange) networks, green space (green), and water bodies (blue). Any remaining space is coded white. 1,665,000 images were used to train the neural network into 1665 classifications.

\caption{Four sample GM images for Paris, France \citep{GoogleStatic2017}}    
 \label{fig:maps}  
\end{figure} 

The second neural network (to be referred to as GS), used Google Maps Satellite imagery obtained through the Google Static Maps API \citep{GoogleStatic2017}. Image type was set to `satellite' using a zoom level of 16 and image size of 256x256. Suitable imagery was not available for two cities, bringing the number of possible cities to 1688 (also excluding Melbourne and Sydney). Training samples of 1000 images per city were taken for a total of 1,688,000 images. Figure \ref{fig:satbeiade} shows four sample images, two each of Adelaide, Australia and Beijing, China.

\caption{Sample GS images for Adelaide, Australia and Beijing, China. \citep{GoogleStatic2017}}    
 \label{fig:satbeiade}  
\end{figure} 

The third neural network (to be referred to as GSV-BSV) used street view imagery obtained through a combination of Google Street View (GSV) \citep{GoogleMaps2017b} and Baidu Maps Street View (BSV) \citep{Baidu2017}. 1000 images each were sampled for the 1074 cities for which imagery was available (a total of 1,074,000 images) at a 256x256 resolution, a pitch of 0, a field of view of 90 degrees, and a random heading from 0 to 359. Images inside tunnels, indoor locations, dark locations, or otherwise unusable images were removed and replaced by iterative sampling.

No street view imagery of China is available through GSV, so BSV was used instead.  In order to minimise the differences between the two data sources as well as to minimise strong country-specific items (i.e. text on road signs) influencing neural network training, further image processing was performed to segment each image before using the images in training and evaluation. The Python module \textit{pymeanshift} \citep{Pymeanshift2017} was used to segment each image \footnote{Using a spatial radius of 6, range radius of 4.5, and minimum density of 50.}. Figure \ref{fig:gsvbsv} shows an example of an original GSV image (of Sydney, Australia) and its segmented version as well as an original BSV image (of Beijing, China) and its segmented version.

Images from Sydney and Melbourne, Australia were excluded from the training data and were instead used for evaluation. This evaluation data was sampled at a 400m grid resolution across the greater metro areas, with 23027 possible locations for Melbourne and 24596 for Sydney. Availability of imagery for GSV at these locations was 59.5\% and 91.1\% respectively. 


 \subsection{Neural network training}\label{sec:methods4}    

%To accurately calibrate the 25 million parameters of the Inception V3 architecture for any computer vision task, it is preferable to use millions of training images with high-quality labels. Therefore, 1000 samples were randomly selected from each city area, resulting in a training dataset of 1.6 million images each for the GM and GS networks and 1.1 million images for the GSV-BSV network. These datasets were randomly split into training (75\%) and validation (25\%) sets. In order to obtain a balanced training data set of 750 images per city, sampling was performed sequentially per city.

Two versions of the Inception network were used in this study. The GM neural network was trained using the Inception V3 network while the GS and GSV-BSV neural networks used the Inception V2 network. 

The Inception V3 network was calibrated using supervised learning with the generated dataset to identify the name of the city based on a supplied precinct-level image. Several pre-processing steps were performed before supplying the image to the neural network. In particular, images were randomly flipped and randomly cropped during pre-processing from 320x320x3 to Inception V3's native 299x299x3 resolution. No zooming is applied and the aspect ratio is kept fixed, while colour transformations are not required due to our pre-specified limited colour scheme. All images were normalised to [-1, 1] by subtracting a colour value of 128 from each pixel and multiplying by 1/128. To ensure good mixing, training images were randomly allocated to batches. Validation images were transformed to 299x299x3 using central cropping.

To update weights in the neural network, a loss function has to be specified to quantify the extent of any current misclassifications. The loss function used in this study is a weighted sum of the cross entropy calculated on the softmax function output of the nodes in the final layer (77\%) and the auxiliary end nodes (23\%). Model parameters are calibrated by minimising this loss function using Stochastic Gradient Descent with Nesterov momentum of 0.9. Other parameters include a batch size of 64 samples, learning rate starting at 0.9 per batch, reduced by 6\% every two epochs, batch normalization, a dropout rate of 0.2 after the final average-pooling operations, and an L2 regularization weight per sample of 0.0001. After Glorot uniform random weight initialisation, the model was trained until convergence for a total of 150 epochs (approximately one to two weeks using one NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPU), using the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) \citep{Yu2015}.

%This resulted in 86.1\% accuracy of the final model for predicting the correct city using images in the validation set (i.e., top 1 error of 13.9\%). Inference of each of the 416,750 images in the validation set also resulted in probability estimates for all 1667 classes the image could belong to. These probability estimates were used in graph-based clustering as follows.

\subsection{Neural network inference}\label{sec:methods5}    
Finally, using the three trained models, inference was performed using the evaluation data sets for Melbourne and Sydney. As Melbourne and Sydney are not present in the training data, the neural network predictions would choose the city with the most similar characteristics for each of the sampled locations. Using these predictions, every location in both cities can be determined to be `most like' some other world city due to the characteristics of the evaluated street map, satellite imagery, or street view imagery.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

Validation, using 25\% of the training data, was performed on each neural network after the training step. The model for GM reached a validation accuracy of 85.4\% (top 5: 7.7\%). The model for GS reached a validation accuracy of 99.4\% (top 5: 0.03\%). The model for GSV-BSV reached a validation accuracy of 43.1\% (top 5: 30.2\%).

The resulting predictions from model inference of the evaluation data were analysed in various ways. First, the top 20 predicted cities for the evaluation points for each imagery data set were calculated (see Tables \ref{tab:melbournesydneyGM}, \ref{tab:melbournesydneyGS}, and \ref{tab:melbournesydneyGSV} for GM, GS, and GSV-BSV respectively).



The GM neural network predictions (Table \ref{tab:melbournesydneyGM}) are dominated by other Australian cities (Brisbane, Canberra, Sunshine Coast, Perth, Newcastle and Lake Macquarie, and Adelaide) as well as a number of cities from Israel, South Africa, and the United States. Australian cities make up nearly 33\% of the top 20 predictions for Melbourne and 32\% for Sydney. Melbourne and Sydney also show strong similarities with each other with the neural network considering them similar to the same 12 cities out of the top 20 predictions (accounting for 45\% and 48\% of the total predictions for Melbourne and Sydney respectively).

The GS neural network predictions (Table \ref{tab:melbournesydneyGS}) show wider divergences from other Australia cities and between Melbourne and Sydney themselves. Both Melbourne and Sydney are often matched to Brazilian cities. Melbourne is matched to Brazil in 39.5\% of the evaluation locations (and 43.6\% for Brazil and Argentina) while Sydney is matched to Brazilian cities in 50.3\% of the evaluation locations (and 54.4\% for Brazil and Argentina). Melbourne and Sydney show wider divergences from each other, only having 7 of the top 20 predicted cities in common. In diverging predictions, 13.6\% of Melbourne is confused with Wellington, NZ while 13.7\% of Sydney is considered much more similar to Sevastopol, Ukraine.

Finally, the GSV-BSV neural network predictions (Table \ref{tab:melbournesydneyGSV}) shows strong similarities between Melbourne and Sydney. In the Melbourne evaluation, just over 30\% (7 of the top 8 picks) are other Australian cities, while Sydney matched other Australian cities for 34.6\% of the evaluation locations (and were 7 of the top 7 picks). In addition, 16 of the top 20 predicted cities are shared between Melbourne and Sydney. But while the top GM predictions are dominated mostly by Brisbane and Canberra, the top GSV-BSV predictions are spread more evenly among a wider range of Australian cities.

To explore the underlying reasons for the identified differences, predicted cities-like for each of the three neural networks were plotted on maps of Melbourne and Sydney. To allow a visual identification of geographically similar predictions, the color scheme for the plots were determined by the latitude and longitude of the predicted city. This color scheme is shown in Figure \ref{fig:colorscheme}.

Figure \ref{fig:melmaps} shows the top predicted cities (those predicted at a rate higher than 0.3\%) plotted against the Melbourne evaluation locations for the GM neural network. Paris-like locations are highlighted with a black star (70 in total). The other Australian cities show a strong grouping in the inner and outer suburbs while the central business district (CBD) region shows no single strong grouping of regions or specific cities. In Melbourne's far outer suburbs and rural areas shows a wide mix of North and South American, South African, European, and Mid-Eastern cities with small localized clusters of each. In the CBD, a few locations are predicted as Paris, France (see detail of the CBD in Figure \ref{fig:melmapscbd}), mostly associated with the Docklands or parklands.

Figure \ref{fig:melmaps} shows the top predicted cities (those predicted at a rate higher than 0.3\%) plotted against the Sydney evaluation locations for the GM neural network. Paris-like locations are highlighted with a black star (99 in total).  Australian cities show up stronger in the western and south eastern suburbs and North American and European cities in the northern and southern suburbs. The CBD and the central parts of the city show less single city or regional groupings but with stronger highly localized clusters of each. Some cities commonly represented in the CBD include Hong Kong, London, Toulon, and Kaohsiung (many cities with waterfronts).

Other Australian cities are only predicted in a few locations around the city. In the CBD, predictions continue to be dominated by Brazilian cities with some more scattered predictions of cities from Japan, Haiti, and Mexico. No predictions of Paris, France have been made by the GS neural network for any evaluation location in Sydney.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}


In the first question raised by this study (is there a `Paris-end' of Melbourne or Sydney?), as the results section above show, we can conclusively state that neither Melbourne or Sydney have a strong case to claim that they are like Paris or have an extensive `Paris-end' of town. Using three different trained neural networks and three different sources of imagery, very few locations in Melbourne or Sydney are confused with Paris by the neural networks. 

However, in looking at the few locations that are deemed to be `Paris-like', there are a number of common characteristics that stand out. A gallery of all of the images for Melbourne and Sydney that the GM neural network found were similar to Paris are presented in Figures \ref{fig:gm_mel_gallery} and \ref{fig:gm_syd_gallery}. There are a number of common elements in these galleries. Many of these map images show large parklands (in green) embedded in the cities. Orange lines of public transport (rail and tram) are prominent in the majority of these images as well as large water bodies (in blue). Large arterial and trunk roads run nearby smaller (often curving) local roads, however these local roads tend to still be larger and do not reach the small intricate layouts of some Asian cities.

\caption{Gallery of `Paris-like` locations in Sydney using the GM neural network.}    
 \label{fig:gm_syd_gallery}  
\end{figure} 

As the GSV-BSV neural network only picked Paris for 0.062\% of the evaluated locations for Melbourne and 0.040\% for Sydney, it can be stated that from a visual street-level view, there is almost nothing about either Melbourne or Sydney that is visually similar to Paris using this type of imagery. In the galleries of `Paris-like' images for Melbourne and Sydney (Figures \ref{fig:gsv_mel_gallery} and  \ref{fig:gsv_syd_gallery}), it can only be inferred that perhaps street trees (of a certain type) are an important part of what makes Paris look like Paris.

Finally, using the GS neural network, none of the evaluated locations for Sydney and only one location for Melbourne were predicted to be `Paris-like'. This means from an overhead remote sensing point of view, there is nothing about either Melbourne or Sydney that shares any similar visual characteristics with Paris.

Despite these disappointing results (at least from the standpoint of some Australian cities aspiring to be mistaken for the `City of Light'), this analysis reveals a number of exciting possibilities for using neural networks to analyse urban areas. This fundamental methodology can be used to look at many different aspects of cities and understand what elements of their urban design leads them to work in different ways, using easily obtained and globally consistent imagery. 

The GM neural network used in this study has also been used to cluster world cities and examine how the make up of cities in each cluster (based on urban green space, amounts and types of public transport, and road networks) impact health outcomes in those types of cities (CITE TO LANCET). 

As seen in the unsuccessful attempt to find significant areas of `Paris-like' locations in Melbourne or Sydney, certain characteristics stand out as strongly influencing how each city fits into a specific typology and of other similar cities in those same typologies. Using the GM neural network approach, urban form can be evaluated. Characteristics that will be influential in grouping cities with a particular typology will include extents and types of public transportation, urban green space size and embeddedness, road network structure, water body inclusion and integration, amounts of informal unplanned open space, and density and topology influences on city structure. Some of the features included in the GM imagery that made cities `Paris-like' were a higher density of trains and trams, large broad sections of urban green space, and an integration of urban green space and waterways.


From the point of view of above city remote sensing (satellite imagery), natural characteristics will feature more predominantly in classifying locations within a particular typology. In Figure \ref{fig:satimages}a, satellite imagery of Melbourne shows a number of colour and terrain similarities with Adelaide, Australia, Campinas, Brazil, Jundia\'{i}, Brazil, Miami, USA, Provo, USA, and Wellington, NZ (all also shown in Figure \ref{fig:satimages}), the cities with the largest number of GS similarities between Melbourne perhaps being more influential than characteristics of built urban form highlighted by the GM neural network.

Finally, in examining the results from the GSV-BSV neural network evaluation, this micro-scaled level of imagery would arguably capture the visual geography that most people would say `this is what makes Paris look like Paris'. Or in the case of this study, these visual elements are what makes Melbourne or Sydney look like Paris. But as \cite{Doersch2012} found in trying to answer the question of `What makes Paris look like Paris?', overall this answer is not based on a small number of famous iconic landmarks (i.e. the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, etc.) but on a vast array of widespread smaller features. These features include elements such as cast-iron railings on balconies, grid-like balcony arrangements, distinctive street signs, streetlamps on pedestals, window balustrades, and Parisian doorways. Other factors that make the two Australian cities less Paris-like are the types of urban vegetation as well as amounts. For example, Paris has a much lower Green View Index (the amount of vegetation visible at a street level), 8.8\% compared to Sydney's 25.9\% \citep{Li2015}. The colour and quantity of street level vegetation will be highly influential in the neural network's predictions. Of all these micro-scaled visual elements, neither Melbourne or Sydney contain enough of these elements to truly have a `Paris-end' of town.



\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this study, we have conclusively answered the question, does Melbourne or Sydney have a `Paris-end' of town with a definitive `no'. Using millions of images of thousands of cities, our three trained neural networks concluded that at best, Sydney could be considered only 0.4\% `Paris-like` while Melbourne can only boast 0.3\%. In addition, our tools now let any city in the world answer the age-old question for themselves, do we have a `Paris-end' of town?

But in answering this question, we have also demonstrated some new techniques for assessing urban typologies based on a number of different urban characteristics. Using three different sources of imagery (street maps, satellite imagery, and street view level imagery), our trained neural networks are able to identify commonalities between a wide number of cities and allow us to see these cities in entirely new ways. Importantly, we have demonstrated that results are sensitive to differences in imagery input information, which must be considered in future applications. 



%Using the GM neural network, urban features such as wide broad green spaces, a high level of public transport, the form and scale of the road networks, and topography and natural features become influential in grouping cities into clusters. Using the GS neural network, natural characteristics become to dominate the grouping of these city clusters. Finally, with the GSV-BSV neural network, micro-scaled visual geographical features (road widths, urban vegetation, building styles, etc.) become the dominant influence on how different world cities are clustered together. This clustering based on various elements of urban form can then allow further analysis in how the urban form influences outcomes with in these areas. Such areas of study can include health outcomes, transportation options, and many other topics.
